       "  'content': 'In 2016, his administration brought an end to the ban on transgender people serving openly in the U.S. armed forces.[507][241] A Gallup poll, taken in the final days of Obama\\'s term, showed that 68 percent of Americans believed the U.S. had made progress on LGBT rights during Obama\\'s eight years in office.[508]\\nObama substantially escalated the use of drone strikes against suspected militants and terrorists associated with al-Qaeda and the Taliban.[509] In 2016, the last year of his presidency, the U.S. dropped 26,171 bombs on seven different countries.[510][511] Obama left about 8,400 U.S. troops in Afghanistan, 5,262 in Iraq, 503 in Syria, 133 in Pakistan, 106 in Somalia, seven in Yemen, and two in Libya at the end of his presidency.[512]\\nAccording to Pew Research Center and United States Bureau of Justice Statistics, from December 31, 2009, to December 31, 2015, inmates sentenced in U.S. federal custody declined by five percent. In August 2013, he criticized Russia\\'s law that discriminates against gays,[417] but he stopped short of advocating a boycott of the upcoming 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, Russia.[418]\\nAfter Russia\\'s invasion of Crimea in 2014, military intervention in Syria in 2015, and the interference in the 2016 U.S. presidential election,[419] George Robertson, a former UK defense secretary and NATO secretary-general, said Obama had \"allowed Putin to jump back on the world stage and test the resolve of the West\", adding that the legacy of this disaster would last.[420]\\nCultural and political image\\nObama\\'s family history, upbringing, and Ivy League education differ markedly from those of African-American politicians who launched their careers in the 1960s through participation in the civil rights movement.[421] Expressing puzzlement over questions about whether he is \"black enough\", Obama told an August 2007 meeting of the National Association of Black Journalists that \"we\\'re still locked in this notion that if you appeal to white folks then there must be something wrong. In order to advance the deal, the Obama administration shielded Hezbollah from the Drug Enforcement Administration\\'s Project Cassandra investigation regarding drug smuggling and from the Central Intelligence Agency.[411][412]\\nOn a side note, the very same year, in December 2015, Obama started a $348\\xa0billion worth program to back the biggest U.S. buildup of nuclear arms since Ronald Reagan left the White House.[413]\\nIn March 2010, an agreement was reached with the administration of Russian President Dmitry Medvedev to replace the 1991 Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty with a new pact reducing the number of long-range nuclear weapons in the arsenals of both countries by about a third.[414] Obama and Medvedev signed the New START treaty in April 2010, and the U.S. Senate ratified it in December 2010.[415] Obama became the first U.S. president in office to call for full equality for gay Americans, and the first to mention gay rights or the word \"gay\" in an inaugural address.[247][248] In 2013, the Obama administration filed briefs that urged the Supreme Court to rule in favor of same-sex couples in the cases of Hollingsworth v. Perry (regarding same-sex marriage)[249] and United States v. Windsor (regarding the Defense of Marriage Act).[250]\\nOn February 17, 2009, Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, a $787\\xa0billion (equivalent to $1074 billion in 2022) economic stimulus package aimed at helping the economy recover from the deepening worldwide recession.[251] In 2001, as co-chairman of the bipartisan Joint Committee on Administrative Rules, Obama supported Republican Governor Ryan\\'s payday loan regulations and predatory mortgage lending regulations aimed at averting home foreclosures.[123][124]\\nHe was reelected to the Illinois Senate in 1998, defeating Republican Yesse Yehudah in the general election, and was re-elected again in 2002.[125][126] In 2000, he lost a Democratic primary race for Illinois\\'s 1st congressional district in the United States House of Representatives to four-term incumbent Bobby Rush by a margin of two to one.[127]\\nIn January 2003, Obama became chairman of the Illinois Senate\\'s Health and Human Services Committee when Democrats, after a decade in the minority, regained a majority.[128]'},\n",

Early life\\nObama’s father, Barack Obama, Sr., was a teenage goatherd in rural Kenya, won a scholarship to study in the United States, and eventually became a senior economist in the Kenyan government. After serving for a couple of years as a writer and editor for Business International Corp., a research, publishing, and consulting firm in Manhattan, he took a position in 1985 as a community organizer on Chicago’s largely impoverished Far South Side.

With no father or other family members to serve as role models (his relationship with his white grandfather was difficult), Obama later reflected, “I was trying to raise myself to be a black man in America, and beyond the given of my appearance, no one around me seemed to know exactly what that meant.”\\n\"}]"
